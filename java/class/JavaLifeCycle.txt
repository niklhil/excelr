Java Life Cycle:
--------------------
1) Source code development
2) Compilation
3) Class loading
       a) All static data members are created and initialized to default values
       b) All static blocks are executed sequentially
4) main() starts 
5) If main() creates any object, then all its instance variables are created and initialized to default values.
6) There after all non-static blocks are executed sequentially
7) Then constructor is executed.
8) main() continues.
9) Finally, main() ends
