•  If package is not specified then the class belongs to default package. 
•  Default package does not have any name.
•  import statement is used to import package contents.
•  import packagename.*: This statement imports all classes of the specified package.
•  import packagename.classname: This statement imports specified class.
•  Multi-type import statement does not import inner packages. Hence they need to be imported explicitly.
