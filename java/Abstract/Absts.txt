Abstract class:
-------------------
Two types of classes:
    1)  Concrete class   (Its object can be created)
    2)  Abstract class    (Its object can't be created)

Abstract Class
-------------------
A class which can not be instantiated and used only as a parent class is called as abstract class. It may contain:

        1) Defined methods
        2) Undefined methods
        3) Both defined and undefined methods.
        4) An empty class can also be abstract

1) Defined methods
    abstract class X
    {
      void test(){}
      void show(){}
    }

2) Undefined methods
    abstract class X
    {
       abstract void test();
       abstract void show();
   }

3) Both defined and undefined methods
    abstract class X
    {
      void test(){}
      abstract void show();
    }

4) Empty class can also be an abstract class
    abstract class X 
    {
    }
