The diamond problem occurs in programming languages that support multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two or more classes that have a common superclass. This creates a diamond-shaped inheritance structure.

The problem arises when the common superclass has a method or member that is overridden in the intermediate classes. When a class inherits from both of these intermediate classes, it faces ambiguity because there are multiple versions of the same method or member.

The diamond problem causes confusion for the compiler as it doesn't know which version of the method or member to use. This can lead to compilation errors or unpredictable behavior in the program.

To address the diamond problem, programming languages have different approaches. Some languages, like Java, avoid the problem by allowing only single inheritance.
