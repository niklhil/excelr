throw:
The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception within a block of code.
You can throw any exception (including built-in exceptions or user defined exceptions) using the throw keyword.
When throw is used, the execution of the current method is halted, and the control is transferred to the nearest suitable exception handler (catch block or caller method).

throws:
The throws keyword is used in a method signature to declare that the method may throw one or more types of exceptions.
It is used to specify the exceptions that a method can potentially throw, allowing the caller of the method to handle or propagate those exceptions.
Multiple exceptions can be declared by separating them with commas.
When a method is declared with throws, it is indicating that the method itself is not handling the exception(s) internally and is delegating the responsibility of handling them to the caller.
