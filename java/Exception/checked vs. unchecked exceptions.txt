Checked Exceptions:

Checked exceptions are exceptions that must be declared in the method signature using the throws clause or handled using try-catch blocks.
These exceptions are usually caused by conditions outside the control of the program, such as I/O errors, network connectivity issues.
Examples of checked exceptions include IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, and custom exceptions that extend the Exception class.
The compiler mandates that checked exceptions are either caught and handled or declared to be thrown. This encourages developers to handle potential exceptional scenarios explicitly.

Unchecked Exceptions:

Unchecked exceptions, also known as runtime exceptions, are exceptions that do not need to be explicitly declared or caught.
These exceptions are typically caused by programming errors such as invalid method arguments, null pointer dereferences, or arithmetic overflows.
Examples of unchecked exceptions include NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, IllegalArgumentException, and custom exceptions that extend the RuntimeException class.
Unchecked exceptions are not required to be declared in the method signature or caught using try-catch blocks. They can be handled if desired, but it is not mandatory.
Unchecked exceptions are designed to be caught and addressed during the development and testing phase. They indicate potential bugs or issues in the code that need to be fixed.
