ArrayList:
------------
•	ArrayList is a List based collection.
•	Its default capacity is 10. However it grows as we add more elements.
•	It is internally implemented by using array of Object class type.
•	It stores elements in insertion order.
•	It allows null values and duplicate elements.
•	It supports index based access i.e. random access of elements
•	It is non-synchronized, hence does not guarantee data consistency in thread environment.
•	It is best suited for data storage and retrieval.
•	Insertion and deletion from the middle of ArrayList is not efficient since it need to shift the elements to reorganize them.
•	It can be navigated using iterator, listiterator and enhanced for loop.
•	Memory consumption is low in ArrayList since it stores only elements.
 
 How to create ArrayList:

                   ArrayList a1=new ArrayList() //10
  	   ArrayList a1=new ArrayList(int capacity)
                   ArrayList a1=new ArrayList(Collection c)
