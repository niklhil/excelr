LinkedHashSet:  
---------------------
•	Its default capacity is 16.
•	It stores elements in Hashtable 
•	It uses doubly linked list to maintain the insertion order of elements.
•	It stores only unique elements.
•	It allows one null value.
•	It uses hashing mechanism to store elements.
•	It provides constant time performance for operations such as add, remove, contains & size.
•	It uses equals() method to compare elements and detect duplicates.
•	It can be iterated using iterator and enhanced for loop.
•	Its default load factor is 0.75 and permitted range is 0 - 1.0 
•	It is non-synchronized, hence does not guarantee data consistency in thread environment.

How to create LinkedHashSet

         LinkedHashSet h1=new LinkedHashSet();   //16
         LinkedHashSet h1=new LinkedHashSet(int capacity); 
         LinkedHashSet h1=new LinkedHashSet(int capacity, float FillRatio);=>default value for fill ratio is 0.75
         LinkedHashSet h1=new LinkedHashSet(Collection obj);
