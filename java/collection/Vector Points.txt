Vector:
---------
•	Vector is a legacy collection based on List interface.
•	Default capacity 10. 
•	It stores elements in the insertion order.
•	It allows null values and duplicate elements.
•	It supports index based access i.e. random access of elements
•	Vector can be navigated by using iterator, listiterator, foreach and enumeration. 
•	It is thread safe (synchronized), hence guarantees data consistency in thread environment.
•	It provides low performance in thread environment since it is synchronized.
•	It allows specifying increment size.
•	It doubles its capacity if increment size is not specified.
•	Even though it is legacy collection it is reengineered to fit modern collection framework.
•	It supports backward compatibility with old projects.

How can we create the Vector?

1)	Vector v1=new Vector();
2)	Vector v1=new Vector(int capacity);  
3)	Vector v1=new Vector(int capacity, int incrementSize);
4)	Vector v1=new Vector(Collection c);

Method of Vector
-------------------------
void addElement(Object)   

Enumeration(i)					
boolean hasMoreElements()			
Object nextElement()
