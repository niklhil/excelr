Map Concept:
------------------
•	Map is a dynamic storage structure which stores key value pairs.
•	Key and value both should be objects.
•	Keys should be unique but values can be duplicated.
•	Maps are based on Map built-in interface. 
•	Maps support auto-boxing 
•	Maps support generics to provide application type safety.

Collection vs. Map:
-------------------------
1) Collections stores only values, whereas maps store key-value pairs.
2) Collections are based on Collection interface, whereas maps are based on Map interface.
3) Collections can be navigaged by using iterator, foreach loop etc. whereas maps can not be directly navigated.

Methods in Map(i) Built in interface:
----------------------------------------------
public void put(Object key, Object value)
public Object get(Object key)
public void remove(Object key)

There are three types of maps:
----------------------------------------
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3) TreeMap
