HashMap:
-------------
•	Its default capacity is 16.
•	It can have only unique keys, but values can be duplicated.
•	It allows single null key and multiple null values.
•	It uses hashing mechanism to store key-value pairs.
•	It does not guarantee the order of the keys.
•	It gives constant time performance for operations such as put, get etc.
•	It uses equals method to compare keys.
•	Its default load factor is 0.75 and permitted range is 0 - 1.0  
•	It is non-synchronized and hence does not guarantee data consistency in thread environment.
•	It provides good performance in thread environment since it is not synchronized.

How to create HashMap

	 1)  HashMap h1=new HashMap();
                 2)  HashMap h1=new HashMap(int Capacity); 
                 3)  HashMap h1=new HashMap(int Capacity, float FillRatio);
                 4)  HashMap h1=new HashMap(Map m);
