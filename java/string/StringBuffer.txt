String vs. StringBuffer
----------------------------
1) String is immutable
    StringBuffer is mutable

2) As string is immutable, repeated modifications of it leads to poor performance.
   StringBuffer's mutability ensures better performance for repeated modifications.

3) equals() of String class compares contents
    equals() of StringBuffer class compares references

4) As String is immutable thread safety can be achieved without synchronization
    As StringBuffer is mutable it uses synchronization to achieve thread safety.
